            <h2>taking 2 dimensions into 3 </h2>
            <p>for my final project, i wanted to bring the 2-dimensional chess board into a 3d space. i’ve seen some “3d” chess board designs before, where the squares protrude out onto the z-axis, however most of these pieces are stationary. I thought it would be interesting if this new vertical space could be fluid and become a part of the game space.

            </p>

                In order to move the squares up and down, I came up with various ideas. I address the formulation of the pen-click mechanism to allow squares to pop up and down in my <a href="https://jenryu.github.io/PS70/week7/index.html" >mvp project</a> 

              </p>

                after this mechanism was set, there were still a lot of issues, namely that in order for the mechanism to work, it must be pushed up a good amount. however, the stroke length of the solenoid was only 4.5 mm, making this impossible. i brainstormed many ways to edit the pen mechanism, such as making the pole longer and the “button” to click it shorter, but that doesn’t address the real issue which is that the solenoid is not able to click the bottom piece over the shaft. additionally, editing the mesh in fusion altered the smooth surfaces of the solenoid, making it harder to spin after 3d printing
              </p>

              <p>
                i took out the part of the clicking mechanism that screws onto the peg board in order to decrease the size of it and decrease the size of my chessboard squares to around 35x35mm. i came up with the method to create a matrix to hold all of my squares by piecing them together and leaving grooves to attach railing. i laser cut this out of acrylic, and puzzled them together, but i was limited w the amount of acrylic available so this took quite a bit of time to play with the correct dimensions.

                a challenge i ran into was that initially i wanted to cnc all the wooden squares in order to give them the groove that will allow them to slide up and down the small rails attached to each square of the matrix. however, the cnc machine took a very long time to complete for only a small portion of the squares, and it also somehow uncalibrated in the middle of cutting, causing most of the grooves to not fall on the edge of the square, but in the middle. because of these constraints, i didn’t attach the rails onto the matrix. i lasercut a peg board to hold the matrix and allow the poles of the click mechanism to come through to push the individual squares up.

                after creating the general shape of the board and the click mechanism attachments, i went back to the gantry system. I adapted the gantry that my group used in the writing machine project, first, i changed the pen attachment from the gantry into one that allows more space for the servo arm to swing and to decrease the length that the servo will need to be to reach the click mechanism. i attached a servo arm extension to it, and once it rotates, it will be able to hit the clicking mechanism. however, many things began to malfunction at this point. i worked on the code for our group writing machine, so i was familiar with it and what i would need to change in order to get my project to work. however, the esp32 got fried and when i replaced it, the servo also had gotten fried. a lot of things broke. the gantry from the writing project was working earlier, but as i was rewiring things, the motor drivers fried, and there were no more left. this put me in a tough situation since this meant i couldnt get the gantry to work at all. however, in principal it would work, and i still formatted the servo motor arm to be able to reach the click-pen mechanism.the stepper motors stopped working at this point too, and that is when i realized the driver motors also got fried! this was a disaster, and unfortunately there were no other driver motors left. so, the only alternative i had was to show the concept of the gantry moving, and then move the servo attachment around.

              <p>
                I programmed the servo to swing fast as it approaches the 90 degree angle towards the middle of the rotation where the clicking mechanism is located, and then decelerate. this is because if it swings too fast, the clicking mechanism won’t go up the entire way to go above the shaft, allowing the system to twist. 
                around this time, the band saw also became out of order, so it was difficult to continue making wooden blocks. i resorted to sawing by hand, to finish mounting the table attachments to allow the board with the clicking mechanisms to hang above the gantry.

            <h3>what i learned</h3>
            <p>in the end, although my board is far from what i envisioned, i think it was a good starting point for a future project. i was told early on that this was an ambitious project to undertake, but i didn’t fully understand how many moving parts there were until now. it was a challenging but rewarding experience!
