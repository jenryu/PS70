            <h2>mvp!!</h2>
            <p>tmy mvp changed throughout the development of my final project. initially, i thought that my mvp would be building the gantry system, similar to that of a writing machine, in order to push squares individually up. this addressed the problem i arose to earlier where i realized i couldn’t realistically use so many linear actuators to push up individual squares, since that would mean having a motor for each square. that is neither practical nor doable within the scope of the project. i thought that this gantry system solves this problem entirely, since if i attach a solenoid to it, the solenoid can move around in a matrix system and directly push the squares up.  </p>
          
            <p>
              however, I couldn’t figure out how to get the blocks to stay up after they are pushed up. I kept trying to come up with different ideas, but whenever the gantry and solenoid moves, the square will fall back down. This was the real MVP problem, since worst case scenario, I can just have multiple solenoids so that at least a few squares would be able to be pushed up. i brainstormed through many different sliding mechanisms, but this was a lot more complex than the problem seemed. I was clicking my pen when I was thinking about this and aHA I had a lightbulb moment! I can use the spring mechanism inspired by a pen.

              <p>
                However, there are still multiple things that need to be modified. The dimensions of the mechanism are not entirely accurate, and I need to increase the height that the clicking mechanism will go up through increasing the number of teeth on the mechanism. Although the clicking mechanism is fairly big, it’s limited in how high it can actually raise the square by. I also didn’t factor in how high the solenoid rises, and the amount of height that the device requires to spin is too much for the solenoid.
              </p>

              <p>
                moreover, I need to create some sort of matrix to hold the individual squares and allow them to slide up after being hit by the solenoid. these are all things i need to address in the next few weeks.
